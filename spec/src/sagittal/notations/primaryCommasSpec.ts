// TODO: STORE BIG TEST EXPECTATIONS IN TABULAR FORM
//  More of these tests should just literally be pulling expectations from tsv files
//  I'm not sure what the value is of representing them as these code structures is
//  I'm afraid it might be really slowing down the compilation of the code when running tests
//  It may be more helpful for people working on the code to see the information in tabular form
//  And maybe these could essentially become replacements for my "Everything Sagittal" Google Sheets file
