// TODO: I wonder if the philosophy should be this:
//  in the implementation, have the absolute minimum amount of info
//  and have things like this exist as tests (could use JiSymbolWithPrimaryComma type)
//  that might solve the dilemma of the "Analyzed<>" parameterized type
//  and some of the rational/not-rational stuff too
//  if this was literally just an id and monzo. everything else could be calculated
//  there are questions of performance, I suppose
//  but also of page load time...
//  yes and perhaps in such a test the comma information would be regrouped with the symbol information, 
//  so it'd be a quick reference
