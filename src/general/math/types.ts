// TODO: Analyzed & Integer
//  - and if you could make Analyzed<> a parameterized thing like Formatted<>, of course it would be a bit different
//  because Formatted<> converts it from whatever object it is to a branded string, just with aspect of that object
//  whereas Analyzed would just extend the object
//  - okay how about this... you've been struggling with Analyzed vs Analysis 
//  so what if it was an Analysis<Thing>? that might help force you to think of it not as a Thing first but as an
//  Analysis first. and then maybe Formatted<Thing> can only be made out of some kind of an Analysis? well no that 
//  doens't work because you have all sorts of Formatted<number> and Formatted<Monzo>
//  - I want to be sensitive to the issue of the type names reading in a consistent direction
//  relative to the variable names, i.e. in the opposite order
//  like how primeExponentExtremas: Array<Extrema<Integer & Exponent<Prime>>>
//  so you'd have an analyzedJiPitch, which would be a Pitch<Ji<Analyzed>> by that pattern
//  but I'm sure you can see how that doesn't really make sense!
//  which maybe just means that the variable name should be jiPitchAnalyzed: Analyzed<Pitch<Ji>>
//  or per my above insight, would be jiPitchAnalysis = Analysis<Pitch<Ji>>
//  okay so would type Analysis<T> = T & T<"Analyzed"> which would allow you to write it like the above...
//  no wait, then "Analyzed" would conflict with the Ji part...
//  (although now that you've mastered the art of a type parameter object, you could have { analyzed: true })
//  - also consider how Rank<_, Integer> is how you make it an Integer... should that just be Integer & Rank?
//  like should Ji<T> just mean Integer & T?
//  yeah but you wouldn't want a Just Intoned Rank... so you should probably have it be Whole<>
//  except Whole numbers are technically only positive... so wouldn't it just be Integer<>?
//  why isn't Integer already parameterized? or is it?
//  so i think this Integer/Whole parameterized thing is independent from the Ji pitch vs not Ji
//  because that's going to be its own thing entirely, where JI must hhave at least one of monzo and ratio
//  and non-JI must have at least one of value/cents and ED maybe
//  - Also parameteized types are great when realistically it could be a ton of different things
//  But avoid it when itâ€™s just either number or integer...
