// TODO: IMPLEMENT EDO PITCHES ON POTENTIALLY IRRATIONAL NUMS
//  starting to think about non-JI pitches
//  what about logarithmic pitch vs acoustic pitch
//  that could help answer the question about what to name that "pitchvalue" thing
//  e.g. how in Erv's writings about golden horograms
//  he names the pitches with values between 0 and 1, like 0.618...
//  that is logarithmic pitch and would require a second piece of information,
//  the 2, to understand what the base was
//  but actually if you combine those two things, you're still good
//  and continued fractions
//  like monzos, it may be a good idea to support those
//  so the continued fraction can be the exponent in this power
//  but it could also just be another option
//  - also think about how for dynamic parameters, unit: is a Step... but difference between a position and an interval
//  - could also represent numbers as continued fractions [3;1,1,1...]
//  - And ina midpoints should be eds, so it may be time to do this now, even before adding EDOS...
//  and along with that, Comma mean should be irrational Monzo (both of the above, i.e. as opposed to Decimal)
/*
Base assume 2
Power - would be a ratio... but like 3/19 for degrees of 19...

Window (is the base, 2)
Ed (19)
Step (3)

call it a Power?
Er, a Power combines a Base and an Exponent

call it a Degree

the existing Window isnâ€™t a base, it gets divided up additively, not multiplicatively
